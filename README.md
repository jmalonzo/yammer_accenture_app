Installable Yammer/Accenture.com web app for [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome)
and [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org) 

*DISCLAIMER* This project is not in any way affiliated with Yammer and
  Accenture, nor it is supported by them. This is just for my personal
  use. I'm hoping that others, with yammer networks especially, will
  find it as a starting point for their own networks.

Requirements
------------

- A recent version of Google Chrome 6, or latest Chromium.

The web apps manifest spec changes often so things may not work out as
expected. When that happens, please make sure you've updated Chrome to
the latest version. And if it still doesn't work, send me an email
with the version of Chrome you're using.

Installing
----------

You can clone the repository and load the app as an unpacked
extension. If you want a Chrome extension package file instead (.crx),
please send me an email.
